# Info

This directory contains `replay.exe`. This is used to "replay" custom `.utracy` files generated by the production server.

`BYOND-Tracy` profiles can use excessive amounts of RAM, upwards of 48GB in a single process if captured normally at runtime. This is not viable for the production server, so they are written as a custom flatfile inside of `data/profiler/`. These need to be read into tracy over the "network" (localhost) via `Tracy.exe` or `capture.exe`. You will need >48GB of RAM for this process. I am not joking.

The version of `replay.exe` in this folder is compatible with the protocol of `Tracy 0.8.2`. Newer versions will not work.
